MetatronX-Labs: Roadmap

Welcome to the official roadmap of MetatronX-Labs â€” an open-source AI/ML/QML research hub focused on building high-impact, multimodal intelligence systems.

--------------

Vision

To pioneer next-generation intelligent models by fusing Classical AI/ML, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), NLP, and Multimodal Learning into scalable, secure, and open frameworks for research, education, and enterprise deployment.

--------------

Phase 1: Repository Foundation

âœ… image-classifier-tf â†’ TensorFlow CNN on Fashion MNIST  
ðŸ”œ text-sentiment-nlp â†’ LSTM/Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis  
ðŸ”œ quantum-ml-benchmark â†’ Qiskit-based QML algorithms  
ðŸ”œ multimodal-vision-llm â†’ Fusion of vision models + LLMs

Next Steps:
- [ ] Publish 'LICENSE', 'README.md', 'CONTRIBUTING.md' in each repo  
- [ ] Add model cards and usage docs in '/docs' folder  
- [ ] Validate all scripts in Jupyter Notebook (QA before push)  
- [ ] Enable GitHub Discussions for community Q&A

---------------

Phase 2: Expansion & Collaboration

- [ ] Add reproducible notebooks for academic & industry usage  
- [ ] Introduce HuggingFace-style model hub with '.ckpt' / '.h5' uploads  
- [ ] Collaborate with researchers (Quantum, NLP, Robotics)  
- [ ] Apply for open-source grants, VC pitch deck development  
- [ ] Integrate TryHackMe-style AI labs for student learning

---------------

Phase 3: Enterprise & Productization

- [ ] Build a secure API gateway for model inference  
- [ ] Launch GitHub Pages or metatronx.ai portal  
- [ ] Integrate advanced QML-based cryptography + post-quantum algorithms  
- [ ] Start MetatronX Foundry: developer toolkit & monetization engine  
- [ ] Publish technical whitepapers and benchmarks  
- [ ] Begin investor outreach and SBIR/STTR-style proposals

----------------

Community

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds (students, researchers, veterans, developers). Stay tuned for contribution guidelines and community roles.
